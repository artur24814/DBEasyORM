DBEasyORM documentation
=======================

Streamlined Object-Relational Mapping for Python and SQL Databases.

üöÄ About the Project
---------------------
DBEasyORM is a lightweight and intuitive Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library designed to simplify interactions between Python applications and SQL databases. By mapping Python objects to SQL tables, DBEasyORM eliminates the need for complex raw SQL queries, enabling developers to focus on writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code.

With built-in support for model definitions, queries, migrations, and transactions, DBEasyORM makes database operations seamless for beginners and experts alike.
